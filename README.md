# Opencv python projects based on Murtaza's 3hr OpenCV tutorial   
### Chapters practiced:   
1. [Chapter-1](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cv_chapter1.py) - Image loading & basic image cropping.   
`imread`-  used to read an image file, `resize`- manipulate the size of the image, `waitkey`- necessary wait-time for persistent image view   
2. [Chapter-2](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cv_chapter2.py) - Display differrnt shapes and text in image file.   
`line`, `rectangle`, `circle`, `putText`- used to draw shapes & text over image
3. [Chapter-3](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cv_chapter3.py) - Image warp perspective.   

4. [Chapter-4](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cv_chapter4.py) - Different image stacking.
5. [Chapter-5](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cv_chapter5.py) - Image hue, saturation & value control.
6. [Chapter-6](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cv_chapter6.py) - Countour detection of different shapes.
7. [Chapter-7](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cv_chapter7.py) - Face detection

### Projects developed:
1. [Webcam color picker](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/cam_colorfinder.py) - Finding/Selecting color by webcam through hue, saturation & value controls.   
2. [Document scanner](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/doc_scanner.py) - Scanning a document in a given image.   
3. [Webcam painter](https://github.com/sinchan-s/opencv-projects/blob/master/webcam-paint.py) - Painter for live webcam video.
